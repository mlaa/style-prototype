<h2>Behind the Style</h2>

<h3>The Italicization of Names like <em>Facebook</em></h3>

<p>In our editorial policy, we treat the Web as a publication medium like others. We don’t give it special treatment unless something inherent in the medium calls for doing so.</p>

<p>Titles of free-standing works are italicized in print, and so they are on the Web. This policy is clear-cut for online works with a single author like <em>People of Color in European Art History</em>. Other sites, like <em>Wikipedia</em>, have a collective authorship but are unified works all the same. Further out on the spectrum, a site like <em>Facebook</em> has no unifying authorial mission: it’s a template filled by independent authors. Yet all authorship there takes place under a heading, <em>Facebook</em>, and the constraints of the template give a character to the content, however minimal.</p>

<p>A good editorial policy should be simple and not demand hairsplitting by writers, editors, or readers. Typography offers few tools for conveying conceptual distinctions. We think that the least vexed approach is to use a single format for all three titles above (and the titles of all other Web sites). To argue that <em>Facebook</em> is fundamentally unlike the other two would require a definition establishing the difference—a definition that can clearly divide all other sites into one of the two categories. The definition would be endlessly debatable, given all the variations in online publication.</p>

<p>There are also practical benefits to italicizing <em>Facebook</em>, <em>Google+</em>, and so on. The italicization results in more readable prose in a tech-heavy discussion that includes many unitalicized capped terms (acronyms, trademarks, names of companies). Further, the style allows for typographic distinction between titles of sites and similar names of companies. Just as italics helpfully mark the difference between <em>The New York Times</em> (the newspaper) and the New York Times Company, so they allow a useful distinction in  “a posting on <em>Facebook</em>” versus “the CEO of Facebook.”</p>

<h3>The Capitalization of Web</h3>

<p>“The World Wide Web” is the name of a unique entity and is thus written with initial capital letters. “The Web” is the short form of the name. In MLA publications, the capitalization is retained in the short form for the same reason that, for example, baseball fans refer to the San Francisco Giants as “the Giants,” not “the giants.” Lowercasing these short forms would imply that the Giants were literally giants and the Web was literally a web. Rather, the names are metaphors. (Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Web, originally considered calling it the Mesh and the Mine of Information—names that enlist other metaphors [23].)</p>

<p>The familiarity of the name has no bearing on this question. No matter how often sportswriters refer to “the Giants,” they’re never tempted to shift to “the giants,” because the metaphoric basis of the term is inescapable.</p>

<h3>The Placement of a Comma or Period after a Quotation</h3>

<p>When a comma or period is needed after a quotation, publishers in the United States typically put the punctuation mark before the closing quotation mark. The reason for this convention is to improve the appearance of the text. The convention goes back at least to the nineteenth century. John Wilson’s <em>A Treatise on English Punctuation</em> (1850) says that it provides for “neatness” (114). A comma or period that follows a closing double quotation mark hangs off by itself and creates a gap in the line of text (since the space over the comma or period combines with the following word space).</p>

<p>British publishers tend to put the comma or period after the quotation mark. But the British usually use the narrower, single quotation mark as the primary quotation mark. There is less of an aesthetic penalty to placing a comma or period after a single quotation mark, since the mark of punctuation isn’t stranded as far from the previous word.</p>

<p>It’s true that the convention followed in the United States treats the comma or period as if it were part of the quoted material. But the practice is “not likely to give a false meaning to the words cited” (Wilson 114). Indeed, this sleight of hand involving punctuation is minor compared with the violence of quotation itself: quoting almost always entails wrenching the original author’s words out of their context, an action that inevitably affects their meaning.</p>

<p>The conventions of scholarly quotation—removing the original context, adapting the extract to fit the new context, and others—are well understood. They don’t unduly compromise the source if they’re followed carefully.</p>
