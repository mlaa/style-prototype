<h3>Q: If my paper has only one source or only one endnote, should the heading still be plural—“Works Cited” or “Notes”?</h3>

<p>No. The heading should be changed to the singular so that it matches the relevant material: “Work Cited” or “Note.”</p>

<h3>Q: Why does the MLA require the use of Times New Roman? It’s a boring font.</h3>

<p>We don’t require the use of Times New Roman or any other specific font. Our guidelines on formatting papers give this recommendation: “choose an easily readable typeface (e.g., Times New Roman) in which the regular type style contrasts clearly with the italic.” The abbreviation e.g. means “for example,” and so Times New Roman is just one example. Any other typeface that fits the description would be acceptable in a research paper.</p>
